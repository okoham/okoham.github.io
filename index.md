# Pippi Longstocking

Pippi Longstocking is the fictional main character in an eponymous series of 
children's books by Swedish author Astrid Lindgren. Pippi was named by 
Lindgren's daughter Karin, who asked her mother for a get-well story when she 
was off school.

Pippi is red-haired, freckled, unconventional and superhumanly strong â€“ able to 
lift her horse one-handed. She is playful and unpredictable. She often makes 
fun of unreasonable adults, especially if they are pompous and condescending. 
Her anger comes out in extreme cases, such as when a man ill-treats his horse. 
Pippi, like Peter Pan, does not want to grow up. She is the daughter of a 
buccaneer captain and has adventure stories to tell about that, too. Her four 
best friends are her horse and monkey, and the neighbours' children, Tommy and 
Annika.
